The T2K oscillation analyses consider numerous systematics constrained by external data, presented in \autoref{sec:syst}. Since ND280 and SK are in the same neutrino beam the high-statistics neutrino interactions at ND280 are used to constrain the simulation prior to analyses at SK---greatly reducing uncertainties on the extracted oscillation parameters. This chapter details that analysis.

The event rate uncertainties on the 2015 T2K oscillation analysis without using ND280 data is shown in \autoref{tab:sk_noprior}, with uncertainties ranging from 12-22\%. The 1R$\mu$ refers to finding 1 reconstructed muon-like ring, the 1R$e$ refers to 1 eletcron-like ring, and the 1R$e$1d$e$ refers to 1 electron-like ring with a delayed Michel electron. By fitting ND280 data, the neutrino flux, interaction and ND280 detector model is constrained: the two former being large contributors to the 12-22\% error budget.

\subsection{Overview}
T2K has two separate groups which use near-detector data with the intent of maximising model likelihood to reduce uncertainty in oscillation analyses. BANFF (Beam And Near detector Flux task Force) and MaCh3 (Markov Chain for 3 flavour oscillation fitting). The two frameworks use identical selections, binning and systematics, outlined in \autoref{sec:ND280:sel}, \autoref{sec:binning_2017} and \autoref{sec:syst}, but different methods of evaluating the model goodness, exploring the parameter space and propagating results to oscillation analyses.

BANFF interfaces to the gradient-descent minimizer MINUIT\cite{minuit} and MaCh3 uses a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo to sample the high dimensional parameter space, outlined in \autoref{chap:mcmc}. Importantly, BANFF attempts to find the global minimum of the test-statistic given the data and the model, whereas MaCh3 explores an area around the minimum test-statistic with the intent of sampling the Bayesian posterior. Therefore, MaCh3 does not necessarily locate a set of ``best-fit'' parameters with covariances assuming a parabolic minimum: instead it provides a full high-dimensional posterior with arbitrary shape. MaCh3 has the advantage of a near and far detector implementation, meaning a simultaneous fit of data from both detectors can be made\cite{t2k_2015,thesis_elder, thesis_leila, thesis_kirsty, thesis_rich}. This avoids making assumptions on the underlying probability distribution functions of the parameters and the likelihood surface, and benefits from fully correlating the models at both detectors, allowing one to affect the other as the fit proceeds.

The following sections detail the ND280 implementation in the MaCh3 framework. The chapter discusses the selections and systematics, fitting to mock-data to find expected sensitivities and perform closure tests, and real data to constrain the systematics for oscillation analyses. Finally, it evaluates the impact on the predicted neutrino spectra at SK used in the oscillation analyses, ending with compatibility and alternative model studies, and comparisons and validations to the BANFF framework.

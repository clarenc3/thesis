\chapter{The Tokai to Kamioka Experiment}
\label{chap:detectors}
The Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) experiment in Japan was proposed and designed in the early to mid 2000s with the intent of observing electron neutrino appearance, alongside precision measurement of muon neutrino disappearance\cite{t2k_loi,t2k_prop}. In 2014 T2K were first to observe electron neutrino appearance, finding a larger mixing angle $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ than measured by the reactors\cite{t2k_disc}, albeit to low significance. \nova confirmed the appearance measurement in 2016\cite{nova_disc}, finding similar values of $\sin^2\theta_{13}$.

The current effort in the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ channel is reducing the allowed phase space of the CP violating Dirac phase, $\delta_{CP}$, and continuing the measurements of $\sin^2 \theta_{13}$. Including the  $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ channel(s) also significantly reduces $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$ uncertainties\cite{nova_neutrino2018}. T2K is currently comparing neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillation parameters, seeing weak hints of differences. Furthermore, the preferred mass ordering is normal, although again at weak significance\cite{t2k_2017}.

\end{figure}

The neutrinos at T2K are born from particle decay---primarily $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $\mu^\pm$---after a proton beam impinges on a target at the J-PARC complex on the Japanese coast, $\sim 120\text{ km}$ north east of Tokyo. The neutrino beam is measured by the ND280 and INGRID detectors $\sim280$ m downstream of the target and a muon monitor station, which provide information on the neutrino flux, directionality and interaction cross-section. The far detector, Super-Kamiokande, sits 295 km downstream of the target station and measures the rate of neutrino interactions on 50,000 tonnes of purified water, detailed in \autoref{sec:sk}. A schematic of the neutrinos' travel is shown in \autoref{fig:t2k_overview}.

	\caption{The suite of near-detectors at 280 m from the target, showing ND280 and INGRID}
\end{figure}

A host of other neutrino detectors---not used in this analysis---sit in the same ``pit'' 280 m from the target station as ND280 and INGRID. Examples include the liquid emulsion NINJA experiment\cite{ninja}, the water target WAGASCI\cite{wagasci} experiment and its magnetic calorimeter Baby-MIND\cite{baby_mind}.

\section{Beamline}
The J-PARC complex\cite{jparc_tdr} is used to accelerate protons using a linear accelerator (LINAC), a rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) and a main ring (MR) synchrotron. The MR has the ability to fast-extract into the neutrino beamline with a design power of 750 kW with proton momentum of 30 GeV/c, using $\sim3\times10^{14}$ protons per spill with 8 proton bunches per spill and a spill cycle of $\sim0.5$ Hz. The spill width, which opens the trigger window at the neutrino detectors, is $\sim5 \mu$s\cite{t2k_det}.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{The neutrino beamline for neutrinos at J-PARC}
	\label{fig:neutrino_beamline}
\end{figure}

The neutrino beamline consists of two parts and is shown in \autoref{fig:neutrino_beamline}: the primary beamline---which takes fast-extracted protons from the MR, bends them to point towards SK, and impinges them on a graphite target---and the secondary beamline---which directs the mesons from the proton-target interaction through a decay volume, finishing with a beam dump. Shortly after the target in the secondary beamline are three magnetic horns\cite{t2k_horns} which are used to deflect (focus) wrong-sign (right-sign) mesons to reduce wrong-sign and enhance right-sign neutrinos. Running the magnets at 250 kA (1.7 T) increases the neutrino flux at SK by factor $\sim17$\cite{t2k_beam}. Taking data in $\nu_\mu$ dominated mode is referred to as Forward Horn Current (FHC) mode, and in $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ dominated mode as Reverse Horn Current (RHC) mode. After passing the magnetic horns, the focused mesons pass through a $\sim96$ m decay volume in which the majority of them decay. Remaining particles strike the beam dump, which stops all hadrons. Surviving high momentum muons ($p_\mu > 5.0 \text{ GeV/c}$) generally pass through the beam dump, after which they are measured by muon monitors. The MUMON muon monitors (one ionisation chamber and one silicon PIN photodiode) infer the neutrino beam direction to better than 0.25 mrad and the beam intensity better than 3\%\cite{t2k_mumon,t2k_mumon2}, and are used to inform the beam simulation group.

The neutrinos come primarily from three meson decays
\begin{align*}
	\pi^+ & \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu 		&  99.99\% 			& & K^+ & \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu 			& 63.6\% & & K^0_L & \rightarrow \pi^- + e^+ + \nu_e 	  & 40.6\% \\
	      & \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e 			&  10^{-4}\%		& &		& \rightarrow \pi^0 + e^+ + \nu_e 		& 5.1\%  & &	   & \rightarrow \pi^- + \mu^+ + \nu_\mu &  27.0\% \\
	      & \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu + \gamma & 2\times 10^{-4}\%  & &		& \rightarrow \pi^0 + \mu^+ + \nu_\mu  	& 3.5\%  & &	   & & 		 &
\end{align*}

\iffalse
\begin{align*}

			& \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e 	  & 0.0001\\

	K^0_L 	& \rightarrow \pi^- + \mu^+ + \nu_\mu & 0.2704\\

\end{align*}
\fi
and one leptonic decay\cite{pdg_2017}
\begin{align*}
\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \bar{\nu}_\mu + \nu_e & & 100\%
\end{align*}

In \autoref{fig:flux_parents} we trace back each neutrino's parent meson. The $\pi$ parent is clearly dominant for both the \numu and \numubar fluxes, although the portion with $E_\nu > 3\text{ GeV}$ consists of neutrinos whose parents are $K$ mesons. The \nue and \nuebar components of the neutrino beam come primarily from the leptonic $\mu$ decay below $E_\nu = 1 \text{ GeV}$ and from $K^+$ and $K^0_L$ at $E_\nu = 2 \text{ GeV}$. Tertiary decay products, e.g. a $\pi^-$ from a $K^0_L$ decay, form large portions of the wrong-sign background.

	\label{fig:flux_parents}
\end{figure}

T2K was the first long baseline accelerator experiment to use the ``off-axis technique'' in which the far-detector is offset from the neutrino beam center\cite{off_axis}. This has three main effects: 1) it focuses the neutrino energy spectra into a narrower ``peak'', and 2) it reduces the wrong-sign background for $\nu_e$ appearance searches and 3) it lowers the overall rate since most neutrions are forward-going. Assuming the neutrino parents are solely charged pions from $\pi^+\rightarrow\mu^+\nu_\mu$, we can approximate the neutrino energy $E_\nu$ as a function of pion-neutrino angle $\theta_{\pi,\nu}$ (colloquially ``off-axis angle''), pion energy $E_\pi$ and mass $m_\pi$, and the muon mass $m_\mu$,
\begin{equation}
	E_\nu = \frac{m^2_\pi-m^2_\mu}{2\left( E_\pi - p_\pi \cos \theta_{\pi,\nu} \right)} 
\end{equation}

For a chosen $\cos \theta_{\pi,\nu}$ there is a maximum pion energy of $E_\pi^\text{max} = p_\pi/\cos\theta_{\pi,\nu}$ giving a maximum neutrino energy of
\begin{equation}
	E_\nu^\text{max} = \frac{m^2_\pi-m^2_\mu}{2E_\pi \sin^2 \theta_{\pi,\nu}} 
\end{equation}

\noindent which maximises when $\pi$ and $\nu$ approach collinearity, and as $\theta$ increases the allowed neutrino energy spectrum becomes smaller. The calculated flux at SK with the neutrino oscillation probability is shown in \autoref{fig:off-axis}. The off-axis angle is chosen to maximise the flux in the primary oscillation dip at $E_\nu \sim 0.6\text{ GeV}$.

\end{figure}

The delivered beam power and accumulated POT has been steadily increasing from run 1 in 2010 to run 9 in 2019. Run 9 concluded with $\sim500\text{ kW}$ beam power, having accumulated a total POT of $\sim3.16\times 10^{21}$\footnote{Or 5.28 mg of protons}: $1.51\times 10^{21}$ in FHC and $1.65\times 10^{21}$ in RHC modes, shown in \autoref{fig:t2k_pot}.

\end{figure}

The final simulated neutrino fluxes for run 2 to 8 at ND280 are shown in \autoref{fig:flux_1to8}. The wrong-sign background in FHC is $\sim18\%$ at the flux peak which reduces due to the lower anti-neutrino interaction cross-section, and the \nue component is less than 1\% in the flux peak. The \numubar flux in RHC is similar to the \numu flux in FHC, and the large contamination of \numu events in RHC mode comes from the higher \numu cross-section rather than the flux.

\section{The Interactive Neutrino GRID}
\label{sec:ingrid}
The off-axis technique introduces the need for precise determination of the neutrino beam direction, as a 1 mrad uncertainty on the beam direction produces a 2-3\% uncertainty on the neutrino energy scale\cite{t2k_det}. Furthermore, sudden discontinuities in the beam or any of its subcomponents (e.g. magnetic horns or target) directly affect the neutrino flux, so measurements of the beam direction are made on a spill-by-spill basis.

The Interactive Neutrino GRID (INGRID) detector sits on-axis, 280 m downstream of the production target. It was designed to measure the neutrino beam profile to accurately predict the off-axis angle and flux at ND280 and SK, and make inclusive neutrino cross-section measurements\cite{t2k_ingrid_xsec}. It has a cross shaped geometry and extends 10 m vertically and horizontally, shown in \autoref{fig:ingrid_det}. The cross consists of 14 identical modules and two off-axis detectors which measure the asymmetry of the neutrino beam. Each INGRID module has nine iron plates and 11 tracking scintillator plates, which are surrounded by veto planes on all sides to reject cosmic backgrounds\cite{t2k_ingrid}. Each module has a fiducial iron mass of 7.1 tonnes, and the total cross spans roughly $1\sigma$ of the expected beam profile.
\begin{figure}[h]

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{The INGRID experiment, used for neutrino beam monitoring of event rates and direction at T2K}
	\label{fig:ingrid_det}
\end{figure}
INGRID also has a second type of module---the proton module---designed to measure neutrino interactions on plastic scintillator. It consists of 34 tracking plates, similar to those in the INGRID modules but with different dimensions, surrounded by the same veto planes\cite{t2k_ingrid_proton}. Some T2K runs have also added an INGRID water module to measure neutrino interactions on water.

INGRID has measured the neutrino event rates within 2\% of the expected\cite{t2k_2015}, with a precision on the beam directionality of 0.2 mrad---resolving the neutrino beam center to 5 cm. The historical event rate and beam direction from MUMON and INGRID over the full beam period used in this thesis can be seen in \autoref{fig:ingrid_monitoring}. Generally, INGRID and MUMON agree within 0.2 mrad in both vertical and horizontal directions, and the neutrino event rate at INGRID agrees with expectation from MUMON and the beam simulation.

\section{The Near Detector at 280 m}
\label{sec:nd280}
The off-axis near detector for T2K is called ND280, and its neutrino-nucleus interaction data is the subject of this thesis. In contrast to INGRID, ND280 was designed to accurately reconstruct and track particles emanating from a primary neutrino scattering vertex at its central region.

ND280 surrounds its inner target sub-detectors, the two fine grained detectors (FGDs), by three time projection chambers (TPCs). This inner region is referred to as the ``tracker'' and it is enclosed by a lead-scintillator sampling electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) on all but the upstream side, at which a dedicated $\pi^0$ detector, the P0D, is placed. The whole detector sits in a 0.2 T magnetic field to enable accurate sign selection and momentum measurements with the TPCs. The magnet yoke is interleaved with a side muon range detector (SMRD) made of plastic scintillator strips which enable high angle tracking of $\mu$ and provides a cosmic trigger. The exploded detector view is shown in \autoref{fig:nd280_expl}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth, trim={0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm}, clip,page=1]{figures/det_chap/view/ND280Exploded-Text-Transparent-Large}
	\caption{The ND280 detector with its sub-detectors, showing the central tracker region (P0D, TPC, FGD) surrounded by the ECALs and the UA1 magnet with the interleaved SMRD}
	\label{fig:nd280_expl}
\end{figure}

Since signal at SK is limited to the single ring $\mu$ and $e$ selections---vetoing any secondary rings from e.g. pions or high energy protons---the detector is designed for low multiplicity cross-section measurements. ND280 also provides information on the single $\pi^0$ cross-sections, a major background for oscillation searches looking for $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$.

The analyses presented in this thesis only use the FGDs and TPCs for particle detection and ID. Future analyses of ND280 data for oscillation analyses envisage using the ECal for PID, and the P0D for forward-going events going through at least the first TPC.

\subsection{Fine Grained Detectors}
The two fine grained detectors (FGDs)\cite{t2k_fgd} are the central targets for ND280, providing measurements of flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino contamination at the off-axis angle of SK ($2.5^\circ$). Each FGD supplies 1.1 tonnes of target material and extends $186.4\text{ cm}\times186.4\text{ cm}\times2.02\text{ cm}$ per scintillator plane. FGD1 sits most upstream of the two and is composed of 15 plastic scintillator XY planes, each plane having $2\times192$ bars. FGD2 provides a hybrid water-scintillator target, in which seven plastic scintillator XY planes---identical to those in FGD1---are alternated with six 2.54 cm thick layers of water. The two FGDs thus measure interactions on both plastic CH---a common target in external neutrino scattering data---and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$---the target in SK.

The FGDs have the ability to reconstruct features of an event independent of the TPCs for contained particles. Isolated tracks are generally of lower momentum and deposit significant energy per unit track length. Summing the total deposited energy of an isolated FGD track provides a means to distinguish protons from minimally ionising particles. Furthermore, stopped pions may give rise to a delayed Michel $e$, which is searched for in the FGD reconstruction with an efficiency above 90\%\cite{thesis_christine}. Additionally, tracks with hits in the TPC are required to match FGD tracks to determine the interaction vertex. Timing information from the FGD and the magnet is used for tracks to distinguish forward-going positive particles from backward-going negative particles, and vice versa, with a timing resolution of 3 ns.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.47\textwidth}

		\caption{Particle pulls}
	\end{subfigure}	
	\caption{Parts of the FGD particle identification, using the energy deposited per track length}
	\label{fig:fgd_reco}
\end{figure}

The measured track length and particle pulls for the pion hypothesis are shown in \autoref{fig:fgd_reco}. The three dominant distributions (electron/positron, pion and proton) are well separated in the pulls, agreeing relatively well with the data.

The FGD is used for daily checks of the neutrino event rates and vertex distributions. It also acts as a cosmic trigger for stopping muons, whose selection is used to determine Michel $e$ tagging efficiencies.

\subsection{Time Projection Chambers}
The three time projection chambers (TPCs)\cite{t2k_tpc} provide the majority of the tracking, energy loss, particle identification and momentum measurements in the ND280 detector. Each TPC is composed of an inner and an outer ``box''. The inner provides the field cage and the outer the ground potential. The inner box measures $1808\text{ mm}\times2230\text{ mm}\times850\text{ mm}$ and the outer box measures $2302\text{ mm}\times2400\text{ mm}\times974\text{ mm}$.  All TPCs use an $\text{Ar}_{40}$:$\text{CF}_4$:$\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$ mixture at 95:3:2, which ionises when charged particles pass through. The ionisation electrons are drifted toward bulk micromegas detectors\cite{micromegas_1, micromegas_2}, amplifying the charge. The maximum drift distance from central cathode to Micromegas is 897 mm, and with the nominal cathode voltage at $-25\text{ kV}$ and micromegas at $-350\text{ kV}$, the drift field is $\sim 275\text{ V/cm}$. \autoref{fig:tpc_sys} provides a schematic of the TPC design.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, trim={0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm}, clip,page=1]{figures/det_chap/tpc/tpc_1}
	\caption{The ND280 TPC design, showing the central cathodes, inner and outer walls, field cages, $\vec{E}$, and $\vec{B}$ fields, and the readout Micromegas and Front End Boards, figure from \cite{t2k_tpc}}
	\label{fig:tpc_sys}
\end{figure}

The readout provides a 3D image of the tracks from charged particles traversing the TPC, where the bending in the magnetic field determines track momentum. Since two TPCs surround each FGD, they provide good tracking and multiplicity measurements of backward and forwards-going tracks. Furthermore, neutrino interactions produce predominantly forward-going muons and pions which leave tracks in multiple TPCs, giving an improved particle reconstruction.

The energy loss as a function of momentum in one TPC is shown in \autoref{fig:tpc_reco} for negatively and positively charged particles. Muon/electron distinction is achieved, and the MIP resolution is $7.8\pm0.2\%$. Using the particle hypotheses outlined in \autoref{sec:numu_sel}, the probability of assigning a muon to an electron hypothesis is 0.2\% for tracks below $p_{true}=1 \text{ GeV/c}$. There is also excellent ability to identify proton tracks with $p_{true} < 0.8 \text{ GeV/c}$\cite{thesis_tpc}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Pi-zero Detector}
The pi-zero detector (P0D)\cite{t2k_p0d} was designed to measure the NC1$\pi^0$ production cross-section, a large systematic for \nue appearance.

The design of the P0D is shown in \autoref{fig:nd280_p0d}. The water target consists of an upstream and central section. The upstream (central) water target---consisting of 12 (13) alternating scintillator-water bag (28 mm)-brass sheet planes (1.28 mm)---is surrounded by an upstream and downstream ECal (not to be confused with the P0D-ECal).

The ECals maintain the triangular scintillator bars but have the brass and water layers replaced by a 4.5mm thick lead sheet and is seven planes each. The entire P0D consists of 40 modules, each being two perpendicular arrays of triangular scintillator bars. Each vertical bar (134 per P0D module) is 2200 mm long, and the horizontal bars are 2340 mm long (126 per P0D module)\footnote{Originally designed for the MINER$\nu$A experiment\cite{minerva_design}}. The active target of the P0D is $2103\text{ mm}\times2239\text{ mm}\times2400\text{ mm}$ and the mass with (without) water is 15.8 (12.9) tonnes.

	\caption{The ND280 P0D side-view}
	\label{fig:nd280_p0d}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
The ND280 electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal)\cite{t2k_ecal} is designed to complement the tracker in full event reconstruction due to its near hermetic coverage of the tracker and P0D regions. It measures photon showers' energy and directions, and is used to distinguish electrons from muons from pions by shower shape. Its primary purpose is to tag and reconstruct $\pi^0$s from the tracker.

The ECal has three main sections: 1) the barrel ECal, surrounding the inner tracking detectors, 2) the downstream ECal, sitting after the last TPC, and 3) the P0D Ecal. The tracker (barrel+downstream) ECal was designed as a tracking calorimeter and reconstructs electromagnetic showers, complementing the TPC where high-angle particles may leave few hits.  The ECals are all made of scintillating polystyrene bars $40\text{ mm}\times10\text{ mm}$ which are adhered to $1.75\text{ mm}$ lead sheets. The ECal design was based on good detection efficiency of $\pi^0$s emanating from the tracker region. The barrel-ECal has 31 layers and the downstream has 34 layers, corresponding to between 10 and 11 electron radiation lengths. This is required to ensure $\sim50\%$ of the energy given to photon showers from a $\pi^0$ decay is contained. 

The downstream ECal is $2300\text{ mm}\times2300\text{ mm}\times500\text{ mm}$ with 1700 $2000\text{ mm}$ long scintillator bars (50 per layer). The four barrel ECal top and bottom modules are $4140\text{ mm}\times1676\text{ mm}\times462\text{ mm}$ and the two side barrel ECals are\newline$4140\text{ mm}\times2500\text{ mm}\times462\text{ mm}$. The top and bottom ECals have $1520\text{ mm}$ bars, and the sides have $2280\text{ mm}$ bars, perpendicular to the beam direction, and 15 $3840\text{ mm}$ bars parallel to the beam. 

The P0D-ECal is slightly different in design since the P0D performs its own shower reconstruction. The ECal is instead present to tag escaping energy and distinguish photon showers from muon deposits at high angles. It instead has six scintillator layers with thicker 4.0 mm lead sheets. It is 155 mm deep, with the top and bottom modules being $1584\text{ mm}$ wide and the sides being $2898\text{ mm}$ wide, with $2454\text{ mm}$ length.

\subsection{The UA1/NOMAD Magnet and Side Muon Range Detectors}
The entirety of the above detector system (FGD+TPC+ECal+P0D) is placed inside the refurbished UA1/NOMAD dipole magnet. It is operated at 2.7 kA to produce a uniform horizontal magnetic field of 0.2 T. The yoke is split into two sections, each made of eight C-shaped flux return yokes. The inner volume of the magnet is $7.0\text{ m}\times3.5\text{ m}\times3.6\text{ m}$, placing the main spatial limitations on ND280.

The side muon range detector (SMRD)\cite{t2k_smrd} sits in the innermost gaps of the UA1 magnet return yoke, surrounding the entire ECal, P0D and tracker. It was designed to measure muons which escape the tracker at high angles---punching through the FGD, ECal and SMRD---leaving few or no TPC hits. The momentum can be inferred from range in the iron and the SMRD, and the tracks can be reconstructed using FGD-ECal-SMRD matching with $\sim70\%$ efficiency. The SMRD additionally provides a cosmic trigger.

\end{figure}

Shown in \autoref{fig:nd280_ua1}, there are 16 iron plates in the magnet yoke, each 48 mm thick and which are separated by 17 mm spacers, leaving space for 15 layers of scintillator. The SMRD consists of 192 horizontal and 248 vertical modules in total. The modules measure $9\text{ mm}\times686\text{ mm}\times955\text{ mm}$ and $9\text{ mm}\times892\text{ mm}\times955\text{ mm}$ for horizontal and vertical modules respectively. Each horizontal module has four $7\text{ mm}\times167\text{ mm}\times875\text{ mm}$ scintillation counters and vertical modules have five\newline $7\text{ mm}\times175\text{ mm}\times875\text{ mm}$, totalling 768 horizontal and 1240 vertical counters. Going downstream, there are three layers of modules in the 1st to 5th yokes, four layers in the 6th downstream yoke, and six layers in the 7th and 8th yokes.

\section{Super-Kamiokande}
\label{sec:sk}
The Super-Kamiokande (SK)\cite{t2k_sk, t2k_sk2, t2k_sk3} detector has served to constrain proton decay and measure solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations since 1996 with SK-I. Starting with K2K in 1999\cite{k2k_design}, Super-Kamiokande has also been serving as a far detector for long baseline accelerator neutrino oscillation searches in Japan, and continues to do so for T2K with SK-IV and beyond. The detector is placed 295 km from the production target in the Kamioka mine in Ikenoyama, located in Gifu, Japan. The mine provides roughly 1 km of rock overburden---or 2.7 km water equivalent overburden---drastically reducing cosmogenic backgrounds. A sketch of the detector in the mine is shown in \autoref{fig:sk_schematic}.

\end{figure}

The detector consists of 50,000 (25,000 fiducial) tonnes of ultra-pure water in a $41.4\text{ m}\times39.3\text{ m}$ cylindrical tank. It is split into an inner (ID) and outer (OD) detector with inner dimension $36.2\text{ m}\times33.8\text{ m}$, where the OD surrounds the ID. The ID and OD are separated by a Tyvek and ``blacksheet'' barrier, and the ID has 11,146 inward-facing 20-inch PMTs and the OD has 1,885 8-inch PMTs facing outwards---providing veto and shielding for the inner detector. The ID has approximately 40\% photo-coverage and provides excellent $\mu/e$ separation, crucial to differentiate muon neutrino disappearance from electron neutrino appearance.

Particle detection in SK happens primarily through production of Cherenkov light. The muon/electron separation is primarily achieved by measuring ring ``fuzziness'', indicating the amount of scattering of the charged particle emanating from the initial neutrino scattering vertex in the ID. Muons and pions are generally highly penetrating whereas electrons scatter often and give rise to electromagnetic showers at T2K energies. Consequently, the former produces sharp rings whereas the latter produce fuzzy rings. The number of delayed Michel $e$ is also used to identify contained muons and pions, and tracks with kinked trajectories are used to discern rescattered pions from muons.

SK is currently closed to prepare it for gadolinium which will add neutron tagging capabilities. Data collection will resume in spring 2019\cite{superk_upgrade}.

\section{Simulation}
The three detectors (INGRID, ND280 and SK) are modelled using the same neutrino interaction Monte-Carlo, namely NEUT\cite{neut}. NEUT is an interaction generator written for the (Hyper, Super)-Kamiokande experiments, with large contributions from K2K and T2K collaborators.

ND280 and INGRID are simulated with GEANT4\cite{t2k_det,geant4}, and the ND280 electronics are simulated with a custom package called ElecSim. The beamline simulation consists of FLUKA2011 \cite{fluka2008_1, fluka2008_2, fluka2011} which simulates hadronic interactions in target and baffle, JNUBEAM (GEANT3-based \cite{geant3}) which simulates the geometry and handles particle tracking, and GCALOR \cite{gcalor} which simulates hadronic re-interactions and is used as a cross-check for FLUKA\cite{t2k_beam, t2k_tn_flux}. The SK detector is simulated with a custom package, SKDETSIM\cite{t2k_sk}, based on GEANT3\cite{geant3}.

The systematics treatment from detector effects are detailed in \autoref{sec:syst}.

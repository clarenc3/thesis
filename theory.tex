\section{A Brief History}

Initial proposal to solve beta decay

Muon decay not conserving four-vectors

R. Davis at Homestake, South Dakota, and the solar neutrino problem. Bruno Pontecorvo's solution.

Super-K solar neutrino flux supporting Davis' result. Flux around 0.5.

GALLEX and SAGE \nue disappearance

SNO 2002, measuring \nue and total neutrino flux: in agreement with standard solar model. nue to total was 0.301 pm 0.033

Super-K measuring numu disappearance, also seen by Kamiokande and IMB

KamLAND and reactor neutrinos

MINOS and K2K long baseline neutrinos

OPERA and ICARUS nutau appearance

Short baseline reactor neutrinos and theta 13

T2K long baseline nue appearance, NOvA

SK nutau appearance

NOvA nuebar appearance

Number of active neutrinos from LEP data and CMB data. Decoherence from e.g. SN1987A

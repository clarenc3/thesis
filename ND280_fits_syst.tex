\section{Systematics}
\label{sec:syst}

The fit aims to constrain systematic parameters for T2K-SK oscillation analyses by using near-detector data. The shared parameters between ND280 and SK are the neutrino flux parameters, and neutrino-nucleus interaction parameters. The nuisance parameters can be considered as the ND280 detector parameters and cross-section parameters that are parametrised as effective on Carbon only. As such, there are many parameters of interest in this analysis, which this section covers.

The systematics enter the fit by changing the predicted event distributions by shape and/or normalisation, which often incur a likelihood penalty for moving parameters away from their prior central values. The penalty takes two forms: either Gaussian or constant. In the case where there is firm reason to believe a parameter is constrained from other sources than ND280 data, the Gaussian penalty is imposed. When external data and/or recent model developments indicate lacking or conflicting knowledge of a parameter, a flat prior is chosen.

For the Gaussian penalty we have
\begin{equation}
	-2\log\mathcal{L}_\text{Penalty} = (X_i-\mu_i) \left(\mathbf{V}\right)^{-1}_{i,j} (X_j-\mu_j)
\end{equation}
for parameter $i$, with current value $X_i$, constant priors $\mu_i$ and covariance matrix $\mathbf{V}$. For a flat penalty instead
\begin{equation}
	-2\log\mathcal{L}_\text{Penalty} = C
\end{equation}
where $C$ is a constant.

\subsection{The Beamline and Neutrino Flux}
\label{subsec:syst_flux}
The flux systematics are split into six categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hadron interaction uncertainties
	\item Proton beam profile and off-axis angle
	\item Horn current and field
	\item Horn and target alignment
	\item Materials modelling
	\item Number of protons on target
\end{itemize}
The simulations are updated each year to improve the modelling, often taking new data in to account. An example is using the dedicated NA61/SHINE T2K replica target data \cite{NA61_pions_rep} to tune the hadron production model at the T2K beam target, and including results from the HARP experiment \cite{harp}.

The fractional errors for the ND280 neutrino flux prediction are shown in \autoref{fig:flux_uncert_fhc} for FHC running and \autoref{fig:flux_uncert_rhc} for RHC running. The uncertainties are $\sim10\%$ in the flux peak region and are dominated by hadron interaction uncertainties, which arise primarily from multiplicity, pion rescattering and interaction length uncertainties. The proton beam profile and off-axis angle become important shortly after the flux peak at about 1 GeV for the right-sign component of the flux.

\end{figure}

Importantly, the hadronic interaction uncertainties are reducible by improved modelling and tuning to hadron production data. An example is the black dashed line and the black solid line in \autoref{fig:flux_uncert_fhc}, which shows the reduction in flux uncertainty from 2014 to 2015 analyses. Additionally, new in-situ beam profile monitors aid in reducing the proton beam profile and off-axis angle contributions.

The flux systematics enter the near-detector and oscillation analyses as bin-by-bin normalisations in true neutrino energy, $E_\nu^{true}$ (GeV), for four different neutrino species (\numu, \numubar, \nue, \nuebar), for each running mode (FHC, RHC), for each detector (ND280, SK). The binning is chosen to reflect the magnitude of the neutrino flux and the changing shape but simultaneously keeping the number of parameters relatively low. The right-sign and wrong-sign species have the same binning, so ND280 FHC \numu is binned the same as ND280 RHC \numubar:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ND280, SK FHC \numu; ND280, SK RHC \numubar, :\\
	$E_\nu^{true}$: 0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5, 7, 30
	
	\item ND280, SK FHC \numubar; ND280, SK RHC \numu:\\
	$E_\nu^{true}$: 0, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 30
	
	\item ND280, SK FHC \nue; ND280, SK RHC \nuebar:\\
	$E_\nu^{true}$: 0, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 30
	
	\item ND280, SK FHC \nuebar; ND280, SK RHC \nue:\\
	$E_\nu^{true}$: 0, 2.5, 30
\end{itemize}
This procedure brings the total number of flux parameters to 100: 50 for ND280 and 50 for SK. The SK flux parameters are not directly constrained in the ND280-only analysis: the strong correlation between the flux at ND280 and SK indirectly moves SK flux parameters when the ND280 flux parameters move. Hence, all 100 parameters are included in the ND280-only analysis. The flux parameters are highly correlated so the likelihood penalties are evaluated with a covariance matrix, shown in \autoref{fig:flux_cov}.

	\label{fig:flux_cov}
\end{figure}

In addition to the variation systematics above, there is also a nominal flux correction applied to each event as a function of its run period (e.g. run 2a), neutrino specie (e.g. \numubar) and $E_\nu^{true}$ (e.g. 0.8 GeV); this is present to correct the nominal flux model with updated measurements. An example of the corrections from run 4a and run 5b is shown in \autoref{fig:flux_ratio}.

\subsection{The ND280 Detector}
\label{subsec:syst_nd280}
The treatment of ND280 detector systematic uncertainties consists of varying the underlying detector systematics---such as the TPC PID, FGD PID, and TPC Momentum scale---and study the impact on the number of predicted events in each \pmu, \cosmu bin. 

The parameterisation of near detector systematics are categorised into pure event or selection-changing. The event weighting can be broken down further into efficiencies (with shapes) and normalisation parameters. When FGD-related systematics are concerned---such as pion tagging by Michel electron identification---the two FGDs have separate implementations to account for geometric and compositional differences. The different sources of systematics, their variation type and assumed probability distribution function (PDF) are shown in \autoref{tab:nd280_systs}.

\label{tab:nd280_systs}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Observable Variation Systematics}
This group of systematics have the potential to change the reconstructed topology, so allow for migration in and out of selections. They can also switch the reconstructed lepton candidate to a different track in the event. The systematic is applied as a smearing to the reconstructed event variables (e.g. \pmu, \cosmu) and then reruns the event selection algorithm on the smeared event.

There are two methods with which the smearing is applied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the relevant reconstructed variable has a known true value, the difference between the two is used as a scaling. The updated value of the variable after the variation is then
	\begin{equation}
		x'_{reco} = x_{true} + \left(x_{reco}^{MC}-x_{true}\right)\left(s + \alpha \cdot \delta s\right)
	\end{equation}
	where $\alpha$ is the random variable from the relevant systematic's PDF in \autoref{tab:nd280_systs}, $s$ is the scaling factor, and $\delta s$ is its statistical error. The scaling factor is defined as
	\begin{equation}
		s = \frac{\sigma^{data}}{\sigma^{MC}}
	\end{equation}
	and
	\begin{equation}
		\delta s = s \cdot \left| \frac{\delta \sigma^{data}}{\sigma^{Data}} - \frac{\delta \sigma^{MC}}{\sigma^{MC}} \right|
	\end{equation}
	where $\sigma^{data}$ is the dispersion observed in data and $\delta \sigma^{data}$ is the error on the dispersion.
	\item If the MC is corrected to match a data mean value. This correction is needed because the effect of a systematic error ($\delta \Delta \bar{x}$) on the selected event relative the nominal MC is not guaranteed to agree with the corrected MC. The updated observable is then
	\begin{equation}
		x'_{reco} = x^{MC}_{reco}+ \Delta\bar{x} + \alpha \delta \Delta \bar{x}
	\end{equation}
	where $\Delta\bar{x} = \bar{x}^{data}_{reco}-\bar{x}^{MC}_{reco}$ and $\bar{x}_{reco}$ is the mean value of the variable $x$, $\alpha$ is a random variable, and $\delta \Delta \bar{x}$ is the associated uncertainty from the reconstructed data and MC discrepancy,
	\begin{equation}
		\delta \Delta \bar{x} = \sqrt{\Delta\bar{x}^2 + \left(\delta \bar{x}^{data}_{reco}\right)^2  + \left(\delta \bar{x}^{MC}_{reco}\right)^2}
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Additionally uncertainties from the magnetic field are special cases of the above:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The TPC laser calibration corrections are used on-top of the B-field mapping corrections, where the latter is applied during reconstruction and the former is treated as an uncertainty. The reconstructed variable is then
	\begin{equation}
		x'_{reco} = x^{MC}_{reco} + \alpha \left(x_{reco}^{New}-x_{reco}^{MC}\right)
	\end{equation}
	where $\alpha$ is the random variable and $x_{reco}^{New}$ is the reconstructed momentum after the updated mapping is applied. This applies to the magnetic field distortion systematic.
	\item If the observable depends on a scale $s$ that is easy to extract from in-situ measurements
	\begin{equation}
		x'_{reco} = x_{reco}^{MC}+\alpha \delta x
	\end{equation}
	where $\delta x = x_{reco}^{MC} \delta s$ is the uncertainty on the observable and $\delta s$ is the uncertainty on the scaling variable. The TPC momentum scale systematic uses this parameterisation, in which $s$ is the scale of the magnet current and $\delta s$ is its uncertainty.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Efficiency Systematics}
The weight systematics are computed from studies which compare data and MC predictions in well known control samples. The multiple ND280 subdetectors enable cross-checks for tracking and matching efficiencies: e.g. TPC2 tracking efficiency can be computed using tracks with segments in FGD1 and FGD2, which therefore should also have a track in TPC2 which can be cross-checked.

Using the sand muon control sample---defined as having a through-going muon track in most of the detector, where the muon was created in the surrounding sand in the ND280 pit or the magnet---as an example, such muons tend to be very forward-going and high energy. Thus the sample is suitable for alignment studies but not efficiency studies since the \pmu, \cosmu phase space is very limited. 

The model used to move to some new phase space assumes the ratio between efficiencies in data and MC are the same in analysis and control samples. The efficiency for the data is then
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{data} = \frac{\epsilon_{data}^{Control}}{\epsilon_{MC}^{Control}} \epsilon_{MC}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon^{Control}$ is the efficiency in the control sample(s). The statistical uncertainty in $r^{Control} = \epsilon^{Control}_{data}/\epsilon^{Control}_{MC}$ is taken into account as
\begin{equation}
\delta r^{Control} = \sqrt{\left(1-r^{Control}\right)^2 + \left(\delta r^{Control}_{Stat}\right)^2}
\end{equation}
yielding the predicted efficiency in the data as
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{data}' = \left(r^{Control} + \alpha \delta r^{Control}\right)\epsilon_{MC}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the random variable. Finally we define the two weights
\begin{equation}
w_{Eff} = \frac{\epsilon_{data}'}{\epsilon_{MC}}
\end{equation}
for events that identify the track correctly and
\begin{equation}
w_{Ineff} = \frac{1-\epsilon_{Data}'}{1-\epsilon_{MC}}
\end{equation}
to propagate the weight systematics on an event-by-event basis.

\paragraph{Normalisation Systematics}
These systematics are simple one-time weights which change the overall event numbers. The FGD mass error is an example of such a systematic: if the mass of the FGD is larger than the nominal, the overall number of observed events in MC should be increased. The weight $w$ is applied as
\begin{equation}
w = 1+\alpha \cdot \delta e
\end{equation}
where 1.0 is the nominal weight, $\alpha$ is a random variable, and $\delta e$ is the systematic error on the source.

\paragraph{Relative Systematic Error Sizes}
\autoref{tab:nd280_syst_error_nu} shows the relative errors from ND280 systematics contribution on the number of predicted events for the different ND280 \numu selections for FGD1. The total error for the CC0$\pi$ selection is 1.66\%, CC1$\pi$ is 3.33\% and CCOther 6.47\%. For comparison, the flux and cross-section errors are generally $\mathcal{O}\left(10\%\right)$. The error increases with selection because the increased track multiplicity and lower ``cleanliness'' of the reconstructed events. 

The largest contribution to the total error is pion secondary interactions, making up $\sim90\%$ of the detector systematics. This systematic has the power to migrate events through selections by changing the number of reconstructed pions. For the CCOther selection the TPC tracking efficiency also has a large contribution (1.79\%), decreasing to 0.44\% for CC1$\pi$ and 0.27\% for CC0$\pi$. The FGD mass contributes 0.6\% uncertainty for all selections, making up 1/3 of the error on CC0$\pi$ selection. FGD2 has similarly sized systematic contributions, although slightly modified due to the geometry: e.g. the sand muon error is smaller in FGD2 due to tighter vetos than in FGD1.

\label{tab:nd280_syst_error_nu}
\end{table}

\autoref{tab:nd280_syst_error_nubar} shows the error table for the RHC selections. The tracking related systematics for the FGD (Michel electron tagging, PID, hybrid tracking) are not present because the number of tracks in the event---defining the 1Trk or NTrk selection---is solely based on the number of TPC tracks present, so has no impact.

The largest systematic by far is the pion secondary modelling (90+\%), as is also the case for FHC selections. The impact is larger than for FHC selections since the source of pions are \numu interactions (typically higher in $E_\nu$ so also higher in multiplicity) and the larger uncertainties on $\pi^-$ re-interaction probabilities. The FGD mass is the second largest systematic for CC0$\pi$, although for the CCNTrk selection the TPC tracking efficiency comes in second, followed by the TPC PID, followed by the FGD mass.

\paragraph{Parameterisation of ND280 Systematics}
The systematics in \autoref{tab:nd280_systs} could theoretically be varied on an event-by-event basis. In practice this is unfeasible because: 1) the event selection framework is not sufficiently optimised to guarantee fast reweighting; 2) some values of variation systematics gave rise to discontinuous test-statistics as events migrated from one topology to another. Whereas the former is purely computational, the latter causes problems for finding minima with gradient descent algorithms, employed by the other ND280 fitting group (BANFF). 

The systematics are instead parameterised similarly to the flux systematics, which ensures both smoothness and fast reweighting. The systematics listed in \autoref{tab:nd280_systs} are varied on an event-by-event basis and 500 random variations are chosen according to the prior covariances, and the number of events are binned in the fit-binning from \autoref{sec:binning_2017}. The content of each bin is then treated as a normalisation parameter which is highly correlated with adjacent bins through a covariance matrix. Finally, an MC statistical covariance matrix and a covariance matrix shifting the MC reconstructed lepton momentum of CCQE events by 20 MeV to roughly emulate the differences in Martini and Nieves' 1p1h model to the NEUT CCQE model are added\cite{t2k_2015}. The central value and uncertainty on the number of events in a bin comes from a the arithmetic mean and the central value is the rms, and a cross-check with a Gaussian fit is done.

Using the fit binning in \pmu \cosmu yields 1624 ND280 parameters, which was reduced to 556 by merging bins with similar features in the underlying bin-by-bin event distributions. The final ND280 detector matrix binning was chosen to be

in which we note a large first momentum bin for many selections. This is primarily because the pion secondary interaction systematic is by far dominant, which generally becomes larger at higher \pmu (which in turn correlates with higher $E_\nu$), leading to enough energy to create a pion. Reducing the ND280 detector systematic binning had no discernible effect for flux or interaction parameters in a fit to mock data.

The result of the detector systematics procedure is shown in \autoref{fig:det_var} for a selection of bins. In FGD1 CC0$\pi$ the worst overall example is the \pmu=1250-2000, \cosmu=0.6-0.7 bin, which has a double Gaussian bimodal behaviour. This is likely from events migrating in and out of the \{\pmu, \cosmu, sample\} combination due to pion secondary interactions. Although a simple fit to the bin content chooses one of the peaks, the covariance matrix entry sits in between the two with an error that covers the bimodality.

The final covariance matrix is seen in \autoref{fig:nd280_cov}, where the majority of bins are highly correlated. The correlation matrix is shown in \autoref{fig:nd280_corr}. We particularly see high correlations for the high-momentum bins (towards the end of each selection). The anti-correlations enter mostly for RHC selections, where bins at low \pmu correlate negatively with bins at high \pmu. There are also anti-correlations in FGD1 vs FGD2 selections.

\subsection{The Neutrino-Matter Interaction}
\label{subsec:syst_xsec}
The parameterisation of the interaction systematics is frequently updated in T2K analyses to account for new theoretical calculations. This includes nuclear in-medium effects such as RPA and 2p2h corrections\cite{nieves1,nieves2}, initial state models such as Local Fermi Gases \cite{lfg} and Spectral Functions \cite{benhar}, and parameter tunes of existing models\cite{ccqe_tuning}.

The T2K and SK experiments both use the custom interaction library NEUT 5.3.3\cite{neut} as their primary neutrino event generator, with cross-checks through GENIE\cite{genie} and NuWro\cite{NuWro}. Hence the interaction parameterisation deals with the models implemented in NEUT and are outlined here. 

\paragraph{CCQE and CC0$\pi$}
The nominal model is generated with a Spectral Function (SF) from Benhar and others\cite{benhar} and a 2-particle-2-hole (2p2h) excitation \cite{nieves1,nieves2} for the CCQE/CC0$\pi$ model. An alternative model uses the Llewellyn-Smith model\cite{llewelyn-smith} with a dipole axial form factor and BBBA05 vector form factors\cite{bbba05} coupled to a Smith-Moniz Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG)\cite{Smith-Moniz}. 

When selecting the default CCQE model for T2K analyses, it was found\cite{ccqe_tuning} that the SF+2p2h model was inferior to the RFG+2p2h+RPA model when predicting external neutrino and anti-neutrino CCQE scattering data from MiniBooNE\cite{miniboone_nu_ccqe, miniboone_nubar_ccqe} and MINER$\nu$A \cite{minerva_nu_ccqe, minerva_nubar_ccqe}. Thus the simpler RFG model was chosen and a one-time weight is applied in \pmu, \cosmu to account for the phase space shift.

In the selected CCQE model we have three free parameters to vary: $M_A^{QE}$, the axial mass in the dipole form factor parameterisation in the Llewelyn-Smith model, and $p_F$, the Fermi surface momentum, for $^{12}\text{C}$ and $^{16}\text{O}$ coming from the Smith-Moniz model\footnote{The binding energy term was found to have a negligible effect in 2015 analyses so was removed}.

The 2p2h effects first have normalisation parameters separated for neutrino and anti-neutrino, and one for $^{12}\text{C}\rightarrow^{16}\text{O}$ scaling. Secondly, there is a 2p2h shape parameter separated for $^{12}\text{C}$ and $^{16}\text{O}$ which is parameterised as a multiplicative weight applied on an event-by-event basis, taking an event's $E_\nu, q_0, q_3$, where $E_\nu$ is the true neutrino energy, $q_0$ is the energy and $q_3$ is the momentum components of $Q = k_\nu - k_\mu = (q_0, q_3)$. The 2p2h model can be parameterised as having terms with and without pion exchange and the interference between these terms. At a value of -1 the shape uncertainty assigns all the 2p2h to $\Delta$-like and at +1 to non$\Delta$-like 2p2h, and an interference term soaking up the lost or gained cross-section is included. The systematic has no net effect on the normalisation of 2p2h events.

The net effect of the 2p2h shape parameter on NEUT Monte-Carlo events generated with an ND280 flux on a $^{12}\text{C}$ target in $q_0, q_3$ is shown in \autoref{fig:2p2h_shape_q0q3}. The $\sim300\text{ MeV}$ shift in $q_0$ from $m_\Delta-m_N$ is evident for the extreme parameter values, whereas the nominal (``Tweak Value = 0'') populates both regions.

\autoref{fig:2p2h_shape_enu} shows the $E_\nu^{reco}-E_\nu^{true}$ bias on the same generated events where the reconstructed neutrino energy is
\begin{equation}
	E_\nu^{reco} = \frac{m^2_f-m_i'^2-m^2_l+2m_i'E_l}{2(m_i'-E_l+p_l\cos\theta_{\nu,l})}
\end{equation}
in which $m_f$ is the final state nucleon mass, $m_i' = m_i-E_b$ where $m_i$ is the initial state nucleon mass and $E_b$ is the binding energy of a nucleon in the nucleus (27 MeV for $^{16}\text{O}$, 25 MeV for $^{12}\text{C}$), $E_l$ ($p_l$) is the reconstructed lepton energy (momentum), and $\cos\theta_{\nu,l}$ is the cosine of the reconstructed angle between the incoming neutrino and outgoing lepton.

\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:2p2h_shape_enu_reco} shows the importance of good 2p2h modelling for SK $E_\nu$ reconstruction: it biases 2p2h events towards a lower energy and so directly impact oscillation parameter fits.

The second group of nuclear uncertainties for CC0$\pi$ comes from the Random Phase Approximation \cite{nieves2}, which effectively describes correlations between nucleons in a nucleus. The net effect is to modify the 1-particle-1-hole\cite{nieves1} cross-section, which in NEUT is parameterised as a look-up table correction to the CCQE cross-section in $E_\nu$ and $Q^2$. The $E_\nu$ dependence was found to be relatively weak, so a $Q^2$ dependent correction was developed to mimic the uncertainties associated with the model\cite{nieves1}. The correction is parameterised as a third order rising polynomial which switches to a decaying exponential at $Q^2=1.2\text{ GeV}^2$. A normal polynomial of form $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ connecting to $\exp{\left(-e(x-f)\right)}$ was found to strongly correlate the polynomial and exponential parameters, so a Bernstein polynomial base was chosen instead. The parameterisation follows
\begin{equation}
w(Q^2) = 
\begin{cases}
A(1-x')^{3} + 3B(1-x')^{2}x' + 3p_{1}(1-x')x'^{2} + Dx'^{3}, & x \le U \\
1 + p_{2}\exp(-E(x-U)), & x > U
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
in which $w(Q^2)$ is the weight from the RPA variation applied to CCQE events, $x=Q^2$, $x'=Q^2/U$, and $A, B, D$ and $E$ are normalisation factors for the four basis functions. Continuity between the functions at $Q^2=U$ is required and $p_1$ and $p_2$ absorb this if
\begin{equation}
	p_1= D+U\frac{E(D-1)}{3}, 
	p_2 = D-1
\end{equation}
The magnitude and uncertainty of $A, B, D$ and $E$ are then chosen to match the uncertainties provided in \cite{nieves2}. \autoref{fig:berpa_throws} shows the uncertainty bands from each parameter for the final values, showing how BeRPA A controls low $Q^2$, BeRPA B intermediate $Q^2$, BeRPA D medium $Q^2$ and BeRPA E high $Q^2$.

\paragraph{Single Pion Production}
The single pion production is described with the Rein-Sehgal model\cite{Rein_Sehgal, Rein_Angular} with lepton mass corrections \cite{Kuzmin_MassEffect,Wroclaw_MassEffect,Berger_Sehgal_MassEffect} and modified form factors aimed at the $\Delta$ resonance \cite{Wroclaw_CC1pi_2014,Wroclaw_CC1pi_2009,Wroclaw_CC1pi_theory}. The tunable parameters all relate to the neutrino-nucleon scattering interaction in the Rein-Sehgal model, which are $M_A^{RES}$, the axial mass for the resonant interaction in the Rein-Sehgal model, $C_5^A(0)$, one of the axial form factors at $Q^2=0$ in the Graczyk-Sobczyk form factor parameterisation, and the size of the non-resonant $I_{1/2}$ background in the Rein-Sehgal model.

The single pion production uncertainties were tuned to selected bubble chamber data from ANL\cite{ANL_CC1pi,ANL_NC1pi} and BNL\cite{BNL_CC1pi,BNL_CC1pi_isospin,BNL_NuInt02}. The parameter values were cross-checked with suggested corrections to the ANL and BNL data\cite{ANL_BNL_corr}, and compared to results when fitting nuclear data from MiniBooNE\cite{MB_CC1pip,MB_CC1pi0,MB_NC1pi0}, MINER$\nu$A\cite{MIN_CC1pi0,MIN_CC1pip,MIN_pion_2016} and K2K \cite{K2K_CC1pip} using NUISANCE\cite{NUISANCE}.

\paragraph{Coherent Scattering}
The coherent scattering model is described by the Rein-Sehgal model\cite{Rein_Sehgal_coh}. An $E_\pi$ dependent scaling factor, listed in \autoref{tab:rein_sehgal_coh}, is applied to match MINER$\nu$A $\nu$ and $\bar{\nu}$ CC coherent data \cite{MIN_coh} and the Berger-Sehgal model\cite{Berger_Sehgal_coh}.
\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabular}{c | c}
		\hline
		\hline
		$E_\pi$ & Weight \\
		\hline
		0.00-0.25 & 0.135 \\
		0.25-0.50 & 0.400 \\
		0.50-0.75 & 0.294 \\
		0.75-1.00 & 1.206 \\
		\hline
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\caption{Rein-Sehgal coherent scaling in $E_\pi$ applied as a one-time-weight to coherent events}
\label{tab:rein_sehgal_coh}
\end{table}

The strength of the coherent interaction is allowed to vary in the fit as normalisation parameters: one for CC $^{12}\text{C}$, one for CC $^{16}\text{O}$ and one for NC interactions. The prior uncertainty is 30\% from inspections of MINER$\nu$A data and the two CC parameters are 100\% correlated in the prior.

\paragraph{Multi-$\pi$ and DIS}
In NEUT the structure functions are taken from the GRV98 parton distribution functions\cite{grv98} with Bodek-Yang corrections\cite{bodek_yang}. The details of the transition can be found in\cite{neut} and is inspired by external bubble chamber data on pion multiplicity. The DIS model is directly from PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.4\cite{pythia}.

The multi-pi/DIS uncertainties come from measurements by MINOS\cite{minos_mult} of DIS interactions on an iron target at higher energies. At $E_\nu = 4.0 \text{ GeV}$ the uncertainties should be $\sim 10\%$, increasing with decreasing $E_\nu$ and is parametersied as 
\begin{equation}
\delta\left(\sigma_\text{CC DIS}\right) = \frac{0.4}{E_\nu}
\end{equation}
NC DIS events do not receive this systematic and are instead controlled by an overall normalisation parameter including other NC interaction modes, explained later.

\paragraph{Subdominant Interactions}
The interaction modes with smaller cross-sections and/or small effects on 0$\pi$ selections are controlled by normalisation parameters.

The NC1$\gamma$ interaction---modelled with the Rein-Sehgal single-pion model with replaced branching fractions---is important because although the cross-section is very small ($\mathcal{O}(10^{-40}) \text{ cm}^2/\text{nucleon}$\cite{thesis_pierre}), the $\gamma \rightarrow e^+ e^-$ process may mimic \nue appearance signal at SK. The prior weight is set to 200\% of nominal after comparing to a recent theory model\cite{nc1gamma}, and the prior uncertainty is conservative at 100\%.

The NC elastic, resonant kaon and eta production, and NC DIS events are all joined together under the ``NC other'' normalisation parameter. The prior is the nominal value with an uncertainty of 30\%.

\paragraph{Electron (Anti-)Neutrinos}
In principle, there may be unmodelled effects present for \nue (\nuebar) and not \numu (\numubar), which could affect parameters extracted from \nue appearance. Since there is dedicated \nue selection at ND280\footnote{With the exception of the upcoming work presented in \cite{thesis_pierre}, included in next year's analysis} to constrain \nue cross-sections or any high-statistics external data, an uncorrelated 2\% uncertainty from radiative corrections and another 2\% correlated uncertainty from second class currents are added\cite{kevin_nue_numu}. These systematics are simply normalisations applied to \nue and \nuebar events separately.

\paragraph{Final State Interactions}
The hadronic pion final state interactions are handled by a cascade implementation of the Salcedo-Oset model \cite{salcedo_oset} when their momentum is less than 500 MeV. In summary, the interaction probabilities are functions of the hadron's momentum and position in the nucleus, with direction and momentum changes tuned to $\pi-N$ scattering data\cite{pion_scattering}, including in-medium corrections\cite{seki}. More details are provided elsewhere\cite{neut}. Above 500 MeV, the interaction probabilities are calculated from $\pi^\pm$ scattering off free protons and deuteron compiled by the PDG\cite{pdg_2010}. To avoid double counting and discontinuities, the two models are blended between $400 < p_\pi<500 \text{ MeV}$. 

The systematics are parameterised as the scattering probabilities for the different interaction processes at each microscopic step in the cascade. These are divided into absorption, pion production, quasi-elastic and charge exchange. Furthermore, the two latter are split into low and high energy regions, above and below the model transition at $p_\pi = 500\text{ MeV}$. For oscillation analyses using the 0$\pi$ topology, the absorption and elastic probabilities are most important since they can significantly bias energy reconstruction by removing pions from the reconstructed event. The prior values and uncertainties come from tuning to world scattering data: $\pi^+-^{12}\text{C}$ for the low energy and $\pi^\pm - ^{12}\text{C}$ for the high energy parameters.

Importantly, the pion rescattering probabilities are assumed to be independent, which is technically incorrect: an extreme value of the pion absorption probability causes a pion to always be absorbed in FSI, so the effect of the remaining pion FSI parameters should be nothing since there is no longer a pion in the event. Such effects are unaccounted for as it was found to have a $\sim1\%$ effect on T2K run 2-4 data.

The nucleon final state interactions are modelled using the Bertini model in GEANT4\cite{geant4} and are neglected since for water Cherenkov detector such as SK, the nucleon detection threshold is rarely reached. However, when nucleons interact to produce pions these pions are propagated through the simulation and are subject to the above systematics.

\paragraph{Parameterisation}
The neutrino interaction uncertainties are parameterised as shapes or normalisations and are applied on an event-by-event basis. In the case of normalisations, an event gets attached to normalisation parameters in accordance with their mode: e.g. a CC coherent event on $^{12}\text{C}$ gets the CC coh. C parameter weight: if the parameter is 1.5, the weight is 1.5.

For shape parameters, each event has associated one dimensional ``splines''\footnote{The implementation uses a ROOT \texttt{TSpline3} class, reflected in the name}, which assumes that the interaction parameters have uncorrelated responses to variations. The weights are pre-calculated through a reweighting routine which calculates the weight of parameter variation $x \rightarrow x'$, where $x$ is the nominal Monte Carlo parameter value and $x'$ is the new parameter value, as
\begin{equation}
	w(x\rightarrow x') = \frac{d^n\sigma(x')}{dX^n} / \frac{d^n\sigma(x)}{dX^n}
\end{equation}
for an $n$ dimensional cross-section calculation for $X$ dependent parameters. Similar to the pion FSI parameters, this is not strictly true since for example a simultaneous variation in $M_A^{RES}$ and $C_5^A$ is not equivalent to a variation in $M_A^{RES}$ followed by a variation of $C_5^A$. This is currently neglected in the analysis since the effect is sub-percent.

An example of three interaction parameters that are parameterised as splines is shown in \autoref{fig:xsec_splines}. The figure compares parameterising the shape as a third order polynomial \texttt{TF1} implementation to a \texttt{TSpline3} implementation, both fitted to discrete calculated parameter variations.

\paragraph{Covariance Matrix}
\autoref{fig:xsec_cov_matrix_prior} shows the final $\sqrt{\textbf{V}}$ covariance and correlation matrix. Only a few parameters are correlated in the prior covariance matrix: the 2p2h shape C and O parameters (+0.55), the single pion production parameters (-0.8 to 0.10), the \nue(\nuebar)/\numu(\numubar) (-0.71), the CC coherent parameters (+1.00), and the pion FSI parameters (-1.00 to 1.00).

The errors in \autoref{fig:xsec_cov_matrix_vij} do not include the flat priors on $M_A^{QE}$ and $p_F$ and that BeRPA U is fixed. Furthermore, the errors are expressed as relative their priors: e.g. the error on $M_A^{RES}$ is not 0.16 GeV but rather $0.95\times0.16=0.152\text{ GeV}$, where the nominal value is 0.16.
